	<h1>130E - Exercise - Object Reference</h1>
	<h2>Surprise. This was really just a simple add-on to 130d:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Reference the TDD test c130e in the file c130d.test.js file</li>
		<li>Create myCity as per instructions. Only creating within the community as per 130d.
			Also updating the API with Key 1 as assigned by the Community Controller.</li>
		<li>Create myFav as per instructions. It is a direct assignment pointing at the same
			address as myCity referenced in the community cityList array.</li>
		<li>Notice that the values like name, population and key are all the same in both
			myCity and myFav. This is because they are the same key value pair. Both variables are
			pointing to and referencing the same address.</li>
		<li>Change the population of myCity. The population appears to
			change in myFav. But again it is just because both are pointing to
			the value at the same address reference.</li>
		<li>Update the population to the myCity city in the API using the key 1.</li>
		<li>We have not yet attempted to add myFav yet to the API, but this is where
			I can prove my code would reject the duplicate. Since myFav also has the
			same key #1 as myCity, it will be rejected because you can not add a second
			city with the same key. It rejects it with API status error 400.</li>
	</ul>
